Game made by **Ambroise rabier**, my first project in **c++**.

I've inspired myself from Unity and from previous projects I've worked on to make my own 'game engine' based on SFML library.

I own no right over music and graphics being used as placeholders.

Looking for a **game artist** and a **game designer** to make this game more interesting. Contact me by mail.

Any feedback is welcome: rabier.ambroise@outlook.fr
